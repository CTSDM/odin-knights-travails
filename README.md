# odin-knights-travails
In this project I have implemented a version a simple version of the Knight's tour sequence. Given a start and an end position, we look for a path with the least movements. It is more than likely that there are more than 1 shortest path possible, however, we just return one of them.

## Conclusion
It has been a short but fun project. It is interesting to realize that for this kind of problem, the breadth first search is a better answer than depth first search.
